# Research Profile

I'm an Associate Professor affiliated with the <a href="https://www.cs.aau.dk/research/Data-Knowledge-and-Web-Engineering/">Data, Knowledge, and Web Engineering (DKW)</a> research group at the Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University (Campus Copenhagen).
I'm currently the team lead for the Copenhagen branch of the Department of Computer Science.
 Before this, I was a tenure-track assistant professor for just under a year in the same group.
I spent three years as a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href="http://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/">Isabelle Augenstein</a> in <a href="https://copenlu.github.io">CopeNLU</a>, one of the NLP groups at the <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/research/machine-learning/">Machine Learning section</a> at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, on multilingual low-resource learning and computational typology.
I did my PhD in Natural Language Processing at the <a href="http://www.rug.nl/">University of Groningen</a> working within the <a href="http://pmb.let.rug.nl/">Parallel Meaning Bank</a> project supervised by <a href="http://www.rug.nl/staff/johan.bos/">Johan Bos</a>, and co-supervised by <a href="http://www.let.rug.nl/~bplank/">Barbara Plank</a>.
I spent most of the final year of my PhD visiting the <a href="http://www.ling.su.se/" id="su_ling">Department of Linguistics</a> at <a href="http://www.su.se/" id="su_b">Stockholm University</a>.

My research is characterised by a high focus on interdisciplinary interaction between linguistics and NLP.
In 2022 I was awarded a <a href="https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/en/Forskningsaktiviteter/Bevillingsstatistik/Bevillingsoversigt/CF21_0454_Johannes-Bjerva">Semper Ardens: Accelerate grant of 5 million DKK from the Carlsberg Foundation</a> which funds three PhD students and a three-year postdoc, focussing on this interaction.
Most recently I've been exploring the possibilities and risks in using Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g. ChatGPT and similar technologies) in the education system.
          
I teach on the <a href="https://www.aau.dk/uddannelser/bachelor/software-koebenhavn">Software BSc. education</a>, where I focus on delivering high-quality teaching, with an approach emphasising elements of interactivity and connecting theory to practice. As a result, I was in 2020-2021 selected by our students as Teacher of the Year at the Department of Computer Science at AAU.
